 * How an edge asks for its routes (`edge.ts`), in what the edge's own image carries, which

 * Every route list has a version, sent with it in `ROUTES_VERSION_HEADER`: milliseconds, larger for
 * a later list. An edge names itself in `EDGE_ID_HEADER` and says in `ROUTES_HELD_HEADER` the
 * version it holds every route of, applied. A server reads as running only once every edge that
 * counts holds the version that first named it running, so an edge says a version only once it
 * holds all of that list, and asks again at once after applying a new one. The list's ETag, sent
 * back as `If-None-Match`, only spares sending a list the edge has already.
