 * socket, and decides nothing about what a refused client is told (that is `front.ts`'s).
 *
 * - An address (an IPv6 one by its /64, which one machine usually holds whole) may hold only a
 *   few connections that haven't said where they are going, only so many that have, and open only
 *   so many a second, pings and joins alike.
 * - A server may take only so many new connections a second, and hold only so many open.
