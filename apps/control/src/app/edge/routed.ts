/**
 * Whether every edge holds a running server's route, so that it may read as running: a player
 * who joins the moment it does is let in, never closed by an edge that hasn't heard yet.
 *
 * Route lists are versioned by the database's time as their read began (`inputs.ts`). An edge says which version
 * it holds every route of (`edges.synced_to`). A server's `route_listed_at` is the version that
 * first named it running, taken after the read that did, so an edge holding that version or a
 * later one holds its route. It reads as running once every counted edge does, and is told so
 * once (`routed_at`). An edge counts while it asks and keeps up:
 *
 * - one not seen for `EDGE_SEEN_MS`, or whose version was older than `EDGE_BEHIND_MS` when it last
 *   said, doesn't count,
 *   and an admin alert says so (`edgesBehind`);
 * - one first seen after a server became running doesn't hold that server back;
 * - and no server waits more than `EDGE_BEHIND_MS` from becoming running, whatever the edges say.
 *
 * With no edge counted, as where a deployment runs none, nothing waits. Not for what an edge does
 * with its routes, which is apps/edge's, or for building them (`service.ts`).
