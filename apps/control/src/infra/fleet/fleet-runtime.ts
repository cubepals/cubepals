/**
 * The fleet: Blockly's servers on Linux machines it manages directly, each running blocklyd, as
 * one more MinecraftRuntime (docs/fleet.md). The application asks for a server's workload and gets
 * a handle; nothing above this file learns that nodes exist. A fleet of one node is a fleet.
 *
 * - Every new home for a world (a first placement, a move, a restore, a rebuild) is a new epoch,
 *   raised by compare-and-set in the transaction that chooses the node, and carried by every
 *   command, copy and handle. Nodes refuse older ones; heartbeats fence superseded copies.
 * - A placement is written before its node is called (`placing`), so a crash leaves an intent a
 *   retry finishes, never a copy nobody knows about.
 * - Nothing here starts, stops or moves a server on its own: the application's jobs call the port,
 *   and its server status stays the only power intent.
 *
 * Parts (`fleet-runtime/`):
 * - `admission.ts`: room to run on a node, claimed before a start and given back after a stop.
 * - `archives.ts`: a world's copies in `fleet_archives`, kept while held and deleted once not.
 * - `ledger.ts`: where each server's world lives, under which epoch, and the history of its homes.
 * - `node-cache.ts`: what the synchronous methods know of each node, reread every few seconds.
 * - `node-choice.ts`: what a server needs of a node, judged by placement against every node now.
 * - `rehoming.ts`: a world's new home under a new epoch, its old copy fenced once the new one holds it.
 * - `transfers.ts`: a copy of a world sent off its node, to the store or a target, whole or in parts.
 * - `workload-api.ts`: the calls made to a node's workload API, each with its path, epoch and timeout.
