# Makes this host a node of a Blockly fleet (docs/fleet-operations.md, "Adding a node"). The node
# endpoint serves this script at /fleet/v1/join.sh, with daemon.json written into it. The line
# `bun scripts/fleet.ts token` prints fetches it only once the fleet CA matches the token's hash,
# and runs it as root:
#
#   sh join.sh <bk1. token> <the fleet CA it checked> [blocklyd join's options, such as --address <ip>]
#
# It installs Docker from Docker's own apt repository if it is missing, gives Docker blocklyd's
# daemon.json if it has none, installs the blocklyd the control plane serves once its sha256
# matches (at /var/lib/blocklyd/bin/blocklyd, linked from /usr/local/bin), and runs `blocklyd join`,
# which writes the configuration and starts the service. On a host that is already the node a
# `--node` token names, `blocklyd join` enrolls it again (docs/fleet-operations.md §8).
