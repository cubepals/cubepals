/**
 * blocklyd's wire types, as the control plane writes and reads them. They are generated from the
 * node's own Rust types (apps/blocklyd/src/protocol/schema.rs writes infra/fleet/*.openapi.json,
 * `bun run openapi:generate` makes generated/ from them), so a field the node renames, retypes or
 * makes nullable fails to compile here instead of on the wire. `Reads` is what the node reads: its
 * API's requests and the answers to its own; `Writes` is what it writes.
 *
 * This file names them for the rest of the adapter, which never imports generated/ itself. Where
 * the control plane produces a type the node reads more loosely than it is sent, a narrowing here
 * holds the control plane to what it means to send.
