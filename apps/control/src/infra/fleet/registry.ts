/**
 * The node registry (docs/fleet.md, "Nodes"): enrollment tokens, enrollment, heartbeats,
 * certificate renewal, and the lifecycle an operator drives. Every write is one transaction, and
 * every time is the database's.
 *
 * Parts (`registry/`):
 * - `node.ts`: a node's row as read, its health, and what the other parts share.
 * - `presence.ts`: whether the node endpoint is up, so silence counts against a node only then.
 * - `enrollment.ts`: tokens, and how a machine enrolls or enrolls again as a node.
 * - `heartbeat.ts`: a heartbeat checked, applied, and answered with fences.
 * - `renewal.ts`: new certificates for an enrolled node.
 * - `summaries.ts`: nodes with their reservations, for placement and operators.
 * - `lifecycle.ts`: an operator's changes to a node, from draining to retiring.
 * - `upgrades.ts`: the blocklyd rollout, one node per region at a time, answered in heartbeats.
