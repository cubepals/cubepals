/**
 * The blocklyd rollout (docs/fleet.md, "Upgrades"): the control plane offers its own blocklyd to
 * nodes running an older one, one node per region at a time, in the answer to a heartbeat.
 *
 * - A node is offered the release only while it is active, not quarantined, beats healthy and
 *   lists `self-upgrade`, and only while no other node in its region holds an offer of it or
 *   failed it.
 * - It is `upgraded` once it beats healthy on the release, which frees its region for the next.
 * - It `failed` when it reports giving up (blocklyd rolled itself back), or when it isn't healthy
 *   on the release within UPGRADE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS of the offer. A failure stops its region's
 *   rollout of that release until an operator retries the node (`retryUpgrade`).
 *
 * The state is a node's own (`fleet_nodes.upgrade_*`), written only in that node's heartbeat
 * transaction, which already holds its row: a beat never writes another node's row, so a node
 * that went quiet mid-upgrade keeps its region waiting until it beats again. The release is not
 * state: it is the binary this process serves, so a new control-plane image starts a new rollout.
 * Which nodes are offered what is read back by `upgradeSummaries`, for `fleet.ts upgrades`.
