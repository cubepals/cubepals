 * The node endpoint in a process of its own, for fleet-runtime.e2e.test.ts. It runs on Node, as
 * production runs it: Bun's TLS server demands a client certificate whenever it asks for one, so a
 * node that has none yet couldn't enroll there.
 *
 *   node endpoint.e2e.ts <ca.pem> <ca.key> <port> <deployment> [<listen host> [<ip,ip…>]]
 *
 * DATABASE_URL in the environment, and BLOCKLYD_STATIC_BIN for the blocklyd it hands to joining
 * hosts and offers to older nodes (FLEET_UPGRADES=off offers it to none). It listens on 127.0.0.1 unless told otherwise, and its certificate names 127.0.0.1 and
 * the addresses given.
