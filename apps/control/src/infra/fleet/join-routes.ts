 * What a new host fetches from the node endpoint before it has an identity, with no
 * authentication: nothing here is secret, and the host checks each piece before using it
 * (docs/fleet-operations.md, "Adding a node"; blocklyd's docs/protocol.md).
 *
 * - `GET /fleet/v1/ca.pem`: the fleet CA, fetched without trusting the connection and checked
 *   against the join token's hash.
 * - `GET /fleet/v1/join.sh`: join.sh, beside this file, with daemon.json written into it.
 * - `GET /fleet/v1/blocklyd` and `…/blocklyd.sha256`: the static blocklyd this control plane's
 *   image carries, and its hash in `sha256sum -c` form. A process without it starts as usual
 *   and answers 404, saying so.
 * - `GET /fleet/v1/blocklyd.json`: that blocklyd as an upgrade offer, version, sha256 and release
 *   signature, which an enrolled node's `blocklyd upgrade` asks for.
 *
 * `blocklydRelease` says which version that blocklyd is, and its release's signature, for the
 * upgrade rollout (registry/upgrades.ts). The signature is the release's `blocklyd.sig`, which the
 * image carries beside the binary; the control plane can't make one, and only passes it on.
 * Enrollment and what follows it are node-endpoint.ts.
