//! The wire types as OpenAPI 3.1 documents, which the control plane generates its TypeScript types
//! from (`bun run openapi:generate`, into apps/control/src/infra/fleet/generated/): the protocol is
//! written down once, here, and neither side keeps a copy of the other's by hand.
//!
//! Two documents, because serde reads a type differently from how it writes it: a field with a
//! default may be left out of what the node reads but is always in what it writes, so `Resources`
//! requires different fields in each direction.
//! - `node-reads.openapi.json`, as the node deserializes: its API's requests, and the control
//!   plane's answers to enrollment, heartbeats and renewal.
//! - `node-writes.openapi.json`, as the node serializes: its views and answers, log lines and
//!   errors, and its own requests to the control plane.
//!
//! Only tests derive the schemas, so none of this reaches the binary. A test fails when a committed
//! document is not what the types say; `BLOCKLYD_WRITE_SCHEMA=1 cargo test --lib protocol::schema`
//! writes them again. The documents don't describe the API's paths: those are in docs/protocol.md.
