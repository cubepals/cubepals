//! Protocol v1: what the control plane sends and what blocklyd answers.
//!
//! The vocabulary is workloads, not containers. A workload is a spec (image, environment,
//! resources, storage, ports, stop) blocklyd keeps running or stopped on this host. Nothing
//! here names Docker, so blocklyd could move to containerd or microVMs under the same
//! protocol. It mirrors Blockly's `RuntimeSpec` (apps/control/src/app/ports/runtime.ts) closely
//! on purpose: an `infra/fleet` adapter would translate field for field.
//!
//! Requests are strict (`deny_unknown_fields`): a node daemon that silently ignored a field a newer
//! control plane relies on — a limit, say — would be worse than one that refuses. Responses only
//! ever grow; clients must ignore fields they don't know. New request fields are announced in
//! `NodeHealth::features` before anyone sends them.
//!
//! Parts (`protocol/`):
//! - `spec.rs`: what a workload is, as the control plane sends it and as blocklyd keeps it.
//! - `workload.rs`: what blocklyd reports about one workload: its view, stats and log lines.
//! - `lifecycle.rs`: the verbs that create, start, stop, fence and delete a workload.
//! - `transfer.rs`: moving a workload's data: export, restore, snapshots and their upload.
//! - `exec.rs`: running one command inside a workload.
//! - `node.rs`: what the node reports about itself.
//! - `schema.rs`: tests only; these types as the OpenAPI documents the control plane's TypeScript
//!   types are generated from.
