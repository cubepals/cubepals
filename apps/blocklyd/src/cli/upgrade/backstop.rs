//! The trial's backstop: a blocklyd that starts on trial and hasn't ended the trial DEADLINE
//! after it started ends itself, with status 1, and the unit's `ExecStopPost` (`blocklyd.prev
//! upgrade --exited`) puts the binary before it back, as after any start that failed.
//!
//! `Upgrader::watch_trial` counts TRIAL_SECONDS only from the end of startup, and stops blocklyd by
//! cancelling its tasks: a startup that hangs never starts that clock, and a task that never ends
//! keeps the process up after it. So this is a plain thread, which a stalled runtime can't hold
//! up, waiting on nothing but the clock and a flag the Upgrader sets when a heartbeat ends the
//! trial.
//!
//! Not here: putting a binary back. Only the binary before it does that after this exit, so
//! nothing here races `watch_trial` or the heartbeat that ends the trial.
