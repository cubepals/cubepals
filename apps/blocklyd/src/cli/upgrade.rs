//! blocklyd upgrading itself to the blocklyd its control plane serves (`GET /fleet/v1/blocklyd`,
//! docs/fleet-operations.md §9): when a heartbeat's answer offers it, which the control plane does
//! for one node of a region at a time, or at once with `blocklyd upgrade`.
//!
//! ```text
//! <state_dir>/bin/blocklyd          the binary systemd runs: /usr/local/bin/blocklyd links here
//! <state_dir>/bin/blocklyd.prev     the one before it, kept to go back to
//! <state_dir>/upgrade/trial.json    an upgrade that hasn't come up yet: from, to, sha256
//! <state_dir>/upgrade/failed.json   the last upgrade given up on, which heartbeats report
//! ```
//!
//! The binary lives under the state directory because the unit's `ProtectSystem=strict` leaves
//! blocklyd nothing else to write, and the unit needs no new writable path for it. A
//! `ReadWritePaths=` naming /usr/local/bin/blocklyd would bind-mount that one file, which a rename
//! can't replace, and naming /usr/local/bin would open every binary there.
//!
//! 1. The offered binary is downloaded over the node's mutual TLS to `blocklyd.next`, and kept only
//!    if its sha256 is the one offered and it runs here, saying it is the version offered.
//! 2. The current binary is kept as `blocklyd.prev`, the trial is written down, and
//!    `blocklyd.next` is renamed over `blocklyd`: one rename, so a crash leaves one or the other.
//! 3. blocklyd exits cleanly and systemd (`Restart=always`) starts the new one. Servers keep
//!    running: they are Docker's, not blocklyd's children.
//! 4. The new one is on trial while `trial.json` names its version: it must reconcile and have a
//!    heartbeat accepted within TRIAL_SECONDS, which ends the trial. Otherwise it puts
//!    `blocklyd.prev` back and exits. One that can't even start is put back by the unit's
//!    `ExecStopPost`, `blocklyd.prev upgrade --exited`, after a stop systemd doesn't call a
//!    success, its `ExecStartPre` failing included. One that hangs is ended by its backstop.
//! 5. The blocklyd put back says why in its heartbeats, until the next upgrade is tried.
//!
//! Parts (`upgrade/`):
//! - `stopped.rs`: what `--exited` goes by: systemd's word on the stop, and the state directory.
//! - `backstop.rs`: ends a start still on trial long after it began, for `--exited` to put back.
