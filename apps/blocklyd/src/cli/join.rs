//! `blocklyd join <token>`: makes this host a node of the fleet a `bk1.` token names
//! (fleet/token.rs), with nothing else to hand. `join.sh`, which the node endpoint serves, runs it
//! once Docker and the binary are in place (docs/fleet-operations.md, "Adding a node").
//!
//! 1. It fetches the fleet CA from the token's endpoint and checks it against the token's hash,
//!    the only thing that vouches for it: nothing is written if it doesn't match.
//! 2. It writes `/etc/blocklyd/blocklyd.toml` with only what the host can't work out (the
//!    deployment and the endpoint), `/etc/blocklyd/fleet-ca.pem`, the token as
//!    `/var/lib/blocklyd/enrollment-token` (0600) and the systemd unit, each whole or not at all.
//!    A configuration already there is kept: what an operator set wins.
//! 3. It runs `blocklyd doctor --preflight`, shows what it found and stops on a failure, then
//!    enables and starts the unit. blocklyd enrolls on its first start, as it always has.
//!
//! What `Config::load` works out from the host (infer.rs) is worked out here first, so a host
//! with two private addresses is asked which before anything is written, and it is printed with
//! how to override it. On a host already enrolled into the token's deployment it changes nothing,
//! unless the token re-enrolls the node this host is: then reenroll.rs swaps its identity, and its
//! fleet CA when the token names a new one. A token for another node, or a host enrolled in
//! another deployment, is refused.
