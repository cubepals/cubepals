//! blocklyd's core: workloads on this host, their records, ports and observations, and every
//! operation the protocol offers.
//!
//! Authority is split deliberately (docs/fleet.md, "The parts"). The control plane owns what
//! should exist and whether it should run. This host owns what does exist: containers, the ports
//! it handed out, where data lives, what it observed. blocklyd never decides on its own to
//! start, stop or delete a workload, with three exceptions it carries out itself (every
//! container's Docker restart policy is `no`): the restart-on-failure policy the spec asked for
//! and resuming what was running when the host went down, both under the execution lease in fleet
//! mode, and stopping a superseded copy it finds running (a fence recorded but not carried out).
//!
//! Operations on one workload are serialized by a per-workload lock, so a duplicate or retried
//! request waits for the first and then finds the work done. Each verb is idempotent: `ensure`
//! compares specs, `start` of a running workload and `stop` of a stopped one are no-ops, and a
//! second `delete` finds nothing.
//!
//! Parts (`manager/`):
//! - `room.rs`: whether the host has room for a workload: memory to run, disk above the floor.
//! - `view.rs`: a workload as the protocol shows it.
//! - `ensure.rs`: makes a workload match the spec it was sent.
//! - `power.rs`: starts, stops and kills a workload when asked.
//! - `restarts.rs`: brings a workload back without being asked, after a crash or a host restart.
//! - `fence.rs`: fences a copy a newer placement has superseded.
//! - `delete.rs`: removes a workload, and its data when told to.
//! - `archive.rs`: carries a world's data between this node and an object store.
//! - `snapshots.rs`: local snapshots of a workload's data.
//! - `exec.rs`: runs a command inside a running workload.
//! - `logs.rs`: reads a workload's log.
//! - `stats.rs`: samples what workloads use.
//! - `fleet.rs`: the node's standing with its control plane.
//! - `node.rs`: what the node reports about itself as a whole.
//! - `reconcile.rs`: makes the records agree with what Docker has.
//! - `persist.rs`: writes a record from memory, in turn with every other write of the state.
