//! What a node sends the control plane, and what comes back: enrollment once, then a heartbeat
//! every few seconds. JSON, camelCase, like the node's own API.
//!
//! A heartbeat carries everything the node holds, every time. A node that was cut off, restarted
//! or rebooted therefore reports its whole state on its first beat back, and the control plane
//! never has to ask what it missed. The answer fences, and grants the execution lease: a
//! heartbeat never makes a node create or start anything it was asked to, only allows it to
//! keep its own restart policy.
