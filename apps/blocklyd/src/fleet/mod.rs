//! Fleet mode: how a node joins a control plane and reports to it.
//!
//! - `token`: the enrollment token's two forms, the pasted `bk1.` one and the bare secret.
//! - `enroll`: a one-time token plus a certificate request gives a durable identity.
//! - `heartbeat`: the node's whole state, every few seconds; the answer can only fence.
//! - `client`: the small HTTPS client both use, and the archive transfers too.
//!
//! Upgrading blocklyd itself when a heartbeat's answer offers it is `crate::cli::upgrade`.
//!
//! The control plane keeps the durable state (nodes, placements, epochs, backups). The node keeps
//! only what it needs to act without it: its identity, its workloads' records, their data.
