//! The heartbeat: every few seconds the node tells the control plane everything it holds. The
//! answer fences the copies a newer placement superseded, and grants the execution lease. It runs
//! until shutdown, whatever the control plane does: a control plane that is down changes nothing
//! on the node. Workloads keep running, and the next beat that gets through reports the whole
//! state again.
//!
//! The node never stops a workload because it lost contact: self-fencing on a lease would make a
//! control-plane outage stop every server in the fleet (docs/fleet.md, "Epochs and fencing"). The
//! lease only governs what the node does unasked, restarting a failed workload or resuming one the
//! host went down under, so a node cut off from the control plane, which may have been replaced,
//! brings nothing back on its own.
//!
//! An answer may also offer a newer blocklyd, which the node installs and restarts into
//! (cli/upgrade.rs); a beat accepted once reconciled ends the trial of one just installed.
