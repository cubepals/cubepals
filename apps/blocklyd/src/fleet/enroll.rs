//! Joining the fleet. A new host arrives with two things from its provisioning: a one-time
//! enrollment token and the fleet CA's certificate. It makes its own key, sends a certificate
//! request with the token, and gets back a durable node id and two certificates for that key.
//!
//! - The CA certificate is the only trust anchor for the control plane, so a node never trusts
//!   whoever answers first. The answer must name that same CA: the node trusts it from then on.
//! - The token authorizes exactly one enrollment, and a node never sends it again once enrolled.
//!   A pasted `bk1.` token (`token.rs`) must name this node's deployment and its CA file; only its
//!   secret is sent.
//!   Until then every attempt asks for the same key, across restarts too, so an answer lost on the
//!   way can be asked for again: the control plane answers a spent token again for the key that
//!   spent it.
//! - The key never leaves the node.
//! - The control plane, not the request, decides the node's name. A CSR's subject and names are
//!   ignored.
